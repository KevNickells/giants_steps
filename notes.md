Structure... could easily be repeated through n cycles; 1st ET, 2nd with more natural 3rds / 7ths, 3rd with those meantone 4ths

Record the chords of the first four bars. Jiggle about with versions of chords and inversions.

1st pass is to record the chords of the first four bars -
Bmaj7, D7, Gmaj7, Bb7, Ebmaj7, A-7, D7-in various iterations

2nd pass is to go through bars 1-4, see if it works.

3rd pass to try out inversions-should be possible to emphasise the melodic notes and also not emphasise-3rd inversion of Bmaj7 starts on the F# of the melody; Maybe D#-B is harsh around that shrug.
